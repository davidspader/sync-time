# sync time

I use both Windows and Linux on the same computer, each on separate SSDs. However, when switching from Linux to Windows, I noticed that the time is advanced by 3 hours. To address this issue, I created a script that automates the clock synchronization process with **pyautogui**. I then compiled this script into an executable file (.exe) using **pyInstaller** and set it to run automatically every time I start the computer.
